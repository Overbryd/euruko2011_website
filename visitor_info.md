title: Berlin Visitor info - Euruko 2011
---

Here we like to share some infos you might find use full when coming to Berlin this spring.

### Venue Location
The Venue "Kino International" is located near the underground station Schillingstra√üe and [really hard to miss](http://maps.google.de/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=kino+international&fb=1&gl=de&hq=kino+international&cid=0,0,5477264429335183868&sqi=2&hnear=&ll=52.520543,13.42171&spn=0.008591,0.022724&z=16&layer=c&cbll=52.520492,13.421893&panoid=8eL5v8Qm62FY2ZrDVNzHHg&cbp=12,65.55,,0,0]), no matter which exit you take (north east is recommended). Schillingstrasse lies on the route of the U5 underground line which goes east from the center and starts one stop away at Alexander Platz. Alexander Platz is a major transport hub where various street car (Tram), underground (U-Bahn) and S-Bahn routes cross. If you have a direct connection to Alexanderplatz from the place you are staying, Euruko isn't far (10 minutes walk or one stop with the U5). 

### Getting around

You can get around in Berlin perfectly with public transports, on the weekend (Fridaynight and Saturday night) all lines operate 24 hours. If you buy a [day ticket Zone AB](http://www.bvg.de/index.php/en/17182/name/Single%2BTickets%2Band%2BDay%2BTicket/article/77357.html) (6,30 Eur) you can use all busses, street cars (Tram), underground (U-Bahn) and S-Bahn the entire day within the city.

To find out connection you can either use the [bvg website](http://www.fahrinfo-berlin.de/Fahrinfo/bin/query.bin/en?ld=0.1&) or use the mobile [FahrInfo](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fahrinfo-berlin/id284971745?mt=8) App, where the downloadable route network might come in handy.

Taxis in Berlin are affordable and there are plenty of them. Call +49 30 20 20 20 or use the iPhone app [Taxi Berlin](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/taxi-berlin/id399786921?mt=8) to order one. The application is free but for the German app store only (of course there are ways around this).
