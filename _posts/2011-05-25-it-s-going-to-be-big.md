title: "It's going to be big"

Yesterday we tried out the projector. It is able to display a stunning 1920x1080 resolution (16:9 format). As for the canvas, let's say it is going to be just big enough. But see for yourself:

On that note, we advise all speakers to enlarge their presentations into a widescreen format with a high resolution. We tried 4:3, it works, but it should only be considered as a fallback.

We are excited to see everyone on Saturday.
