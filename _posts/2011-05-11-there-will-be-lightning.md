title: There will be lightning

![Gong](/images/gong.jpg)

As you can see in our [agenda](/agenda.html) there are going to be two slots for lightning talks. We are big fans of lightning talks because we think that a lot of interesting things come out of it.

So if you have something you would like to present, this is your chance. There is only one rule: Your talk must fit into 5 minutes including questions. For those of you who remember last year’s gong, that’s what you are going to hear after the 5 minutes are up, adding the thunder to your lightning.

So how does one apply to give a lightning talk? There will be a whiteboard at the conference where everyone can add talks. It will be first come first serve.
