title: Get your Proposals together
---

Hi folks the conference season is coming up again and we are in the middle of the fray. We already gathered most of our financial resources thanks to our awesome community that broke the record of last years supporter ticket sales (aka micro sponsorships) and our super engaged local sponsors. We are looking forward to an awesome time in Berlin.

We gave you a lot of time for the Call for Proposal because we want the best. **The Call is out since 32 days already but we are approaching the finish line in 7 days.** So stretch your fingers and let them fly over your keyboard. So far we have some interesting submissions e.g. twitter message analysis and presenters e.g. Pat Allen. 

But nothing is decided yet, so impress, challenge or surprise us with your talk submission. If you never spoke at a major conference before, Euruko is your chance to enter high, just submit your talk before the deadline. Are you a speaker veteran and tired of oversold impersonal mega conferences with a lemmingish audience? We care and want to hear your stories if you submit them. And here is an additional motivation for you to submit a talk: given that the last EuRuKo was sold out within hours it is more likely that you get to the conference with a talk than by a regular ticket ;)
