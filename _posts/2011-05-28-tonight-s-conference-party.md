We invite you to party with us and all the EuRuCamp visitors at "Tante Käthe". This location is a pretty unknown jewel of Berlin located right inside the Mauerpark. As hard as it is to find, as fun it will get.
Unlike announced on the "Agenda", there will be **no BBQ**. We're sorry, but please pick up some food on your way.

Getting to the location might be a bit hard. We try to make it easy for you, by providing the possible routes on our **[Visitor Info Map](http://goo.gl/maps/oU1Y)**. We will also provide flyers with exact directions.

Please take note of the following map, the location is easy to find if you follow the paths:
