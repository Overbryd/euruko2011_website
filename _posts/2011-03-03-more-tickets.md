The next two batches of tickets will go on sale soon. 

We were a bit surprised by the stampede on Tuesday -- the first batch was sold out within seconds. Therefore we have set up a registration form that will give us a rough idea of how many people want to attend the conference. If the demand is dramatically higher than the available number of tickets, we will try to figure out a creative solution. We already have some ideas ...

Please register here if you plan to attend the conference:

### And here are the details for the next two batches:

* Sunday, 2010-03-06, 13:00 CET -- 100 Tickets
* Wednesday, 2010-03-09, 18:00 CET -- 100 Tickets

The booking page is the same as last time:

Please note that once you have successfully reached page 2 (“Purchaser and ticket data”), the ticket is already reserved and you have 15 minutes to complete the registration. We have removed the (misleading) counter which displays the number of tickets still available, as this seems to have caused a lot of confusion.

Another tip: If the booking page keeps displaying “Not yet available”, you have to open it again in another browser -- there seems to be a problem with stale sessions sometimes. We apologize for any inconvenience with the ticket system. Amiando has been informed about the issues we encountered during the first batch.
