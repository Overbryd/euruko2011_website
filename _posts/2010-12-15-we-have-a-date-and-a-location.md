title: We have a date and a location
---

Hello everybody!

It's been a while since we last posted an update on our blog. But here it is, and it contains the most important information for you.

Pull out your calendar and mark this date:

## 28th to 29th of May

Besides that, we have a contract with the location where the conference is taking place. And this took us way longer than we expected. But the time was worth it, because next year's conference will be held in a cinema!

The place is called *Kino International* and is one of Berlins most famous cinemas, probably best known from premier shows of the Berlinale.

Cheers,

Lukas
