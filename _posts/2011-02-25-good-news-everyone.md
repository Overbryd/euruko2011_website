**UPDATE**: We also accept PayPal now.

The first regular tickets will finally go on sale next Tuesday.

EuRuKo tickets sold out on the first day last year. Therefore, we have decided to offer the tickets in multiple batches this time, so everybody will have a chance (or rather multiple chances) to grab one.

Here are the facts about the first regular batch:

* date: **2011-03-01** (Tuesday, March 1st)
* time: **20:00 UTC** -- that means 21:00 local time in cities like Berlin, Krakow, Barcelona, Prague, Vienna ... check [everytimezone.com](http://everytimezone.com)
* price: 36 â‚¬ (including 19% German VAT)
* quantity: 50 tickets
* payment: credit cards, paypal

### What if I don't get one? 

Don't worry. There will be at least 2 more batches, they will go on sale on different weekdays and at different times, and we will announce them a few days in advance.

### Why did it take so long?

We could not get PayPal to remove our account limit. After weeks of back and forth, handing in all sorts of papers and making several phone calls, we are still waiting. Therefore, we decided to ditch PayPal and find a new ticketing provider which handles all payments for us.

Last but not least,  we would like to thank our four main sponsors (which we will unveil soon) and our numerous supporters -- without them, EuRuKo tickets would cost at least 3 times as much.
