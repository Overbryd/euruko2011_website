As announced on the [agenda](/agenda.html), there is a pre conference meetup tonight (Friday, May 27th) at [c-base](http://www.c-base.org/cv50f/core/impressum.html) starting around 9 PM.

You can find the location on the [Visitor Info Map](http://goo.gl/maps/gwcZ). The closest subway/S-Bahn station is called "S+U Jannowitzbr√ºcke". You need to go through the entrance of this house.

If you have an Android phone or any other flash enabled device, you can have a look at the street view of the entrance [here](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=safari&q=rungestrasse+20,+berlin&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Rungestra%C3%9Fe+20,+Mitte+10179+Berlin,+Germany&ll=52.51058,13.422568&spn=0.011427,0.028989&t=h&z=16&layer=c&cbll=52.512244,13.419762&panoid=l53DWWNnm3rLb8bffbNEJA&cbp=12,17.25,,1,2.74).
