title: After EuRuKo is before EuRuKo

EuRuKo 2010 was a an amazing and memorable event organized by an awesome team. A small group of Rubyists dressed in colorful shirts set out to bring EuRuKo 2011 to Berlin. To win the audience over, we sang our hearts out performing 'Bolle reiste jüngst' on stage in exuberant fashion.

And it worked. The gong has been passed on to us and successfully found its way to Berlin. Since then, we've formed a team of organizers and supporters, striving to continue the series of great conferences with the unique EuRuKo feeling.

We really hope that the wonderful Ela will agree to handle the gong during next years lightning talks. She did such a great job this year.

Time has passed and we started preparations. Currently we are scouting for a great location with character that is authentic Berlin and also provides a great venue for a technical conference.

That's it for the first update. Stay tuned for more...
