Since midnight, the call for papers is closed. 
We have received 86 talk proposals (the last one at 23:57).
Thanks everybody for sending us your ideas -- EuRuKo would not be possible 
without passionate speakers. 

You will be notified by email whether your proposal has been accepted or not.
But please be patient -- it will take us some time to put together the final program,
as there are only around 20 slots available.

Next up: tickets. Stay tuned!
