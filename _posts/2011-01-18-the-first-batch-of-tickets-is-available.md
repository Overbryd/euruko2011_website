title: The first batch of tickets is available
---

Today, we would like to tell you how the ticket sale is going to work.
There will be two types of tickets: regular tickets, and supporter tickets (for micro sponsors).
Tickets will be sold in batches so that everyone gets multiple chances to buy a ticket.

The first batch of tickets to go on sale **today** are 30 supporter tickets, at 300 € _(357 € incl. 19% German VAT)_.
If you decide to buy a supporter ticket, you will become an **official sponsor** of EuRuKo 2011,
and we will put your logo on the website. See the [sponsoring brochure](http://docs.google.com/viewer?embedded=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fge.tt%2F5EKdlmm%2Feuruko_sponsorenbroschu%25CC%2588re_v03_rz_110118.pdf) for more information.

We want to keep the price of regular tickets as low as possible, to create an event
that is easily affordable for everyone in the Ruby community. EuRuKo is a non-profit event,
and the ticket price will mainly depend on the sponsorships we receive –
this is why we offer the supporter tickets first.

If you want to become a sponsor of EuRuKo 2011 and support the Ruby community, then
please consider buying a supporter ticket:
