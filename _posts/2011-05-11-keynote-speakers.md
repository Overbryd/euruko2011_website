title: The Keynote speakers
---

We are super excited to announce our two EuRuKo keynote speakers

* Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)
* Paul Campbell

Having the creator of the Ruby language as a speaker is a great honor for us. His regular appearance at the EuRuKo speaks of his dedication to the community while his humble and inspiring talks always left a lasting impression. Matz’s presentation at last year’s EuRuKo was one of the highlights and his [We are Blave](http://www.flickr.com/photos/applicake/4748871780/) slide became legendary.

Paul is an amazingly talented speaker and his slide style make his talks even more exceptional. He has impressed us where ever we saw him speaking throughout the last year and we are anxious to see what he has prepared for us this time.
