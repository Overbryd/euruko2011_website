    <h3>Pat Allan</h3>
    <h2>Tales of the Big White Cloud</h2>
    <p>
      Pat Allan is a freelancing web developer usually located in Melbourne, Australia. When not caught up in code, he can be found helping organise <a href="http://railscamps.com/">Rails Camps</a> and <a href="http://trampolineday.com/">Trampolines</a>. His thoughts are blogged semi-regularly at <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/">freelancing-gods.com</a>, and he’s been known to make a mean pancake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud may look all light and fluffy, but should you go flying through the depths of the internet, you will find challenges and pitfalls aplenty. Gather round as Pat puts on his storytelling hat and regales you with tales of the trials and tribulations, the technology and automation, the lessons and rewards that are part of building a service in the cloud.

    <h3>Ben Langfeld / Ben Klang</h3>
    <h2>Getting Hands On with Adhearsion</h2>
    <p>
      A recovering Physics graduate, Ben now spends approximately 25 hours per day slinging Ruby and is enjoying it a lot more than quantum field theory.

      Writing voice applications is a perfect fit for him, not least as a result of his addiction to talking. That this can be directed towards a robot can only make the world a better place.
      
      Ben has a passion for integrating multiple technologies and has some interesting examples to share to demonstrate the power of Ruby in the field of communications.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Adhearsion is the first open source framework to enable the creation of telephony applications. Watch as they demonstrate how to integrate with an existing Asterisk install or develop something fresh and interactive in the cloud. Use your phone to send instant messages or collect data. Plenty of code examples will be shared as they show you how to teach Ruby new telephony tricks.

     <h3>Nick Sutterer</h3>
     <h2>Be Restful. Be web 2.0. But don't mix it</h2>
     <p>
       Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of
       open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of
       the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the
       concepts of component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails,
       proving that there should be no such thing as a
       double-render error, and that one need not be slave to the great
       monolithic view mentality. Also, he would like to have beer with you.
       
     </p>
     <p>
       While you were hacking on your frontend, frantically trying to make
       that form do a PUT, just to be “RESTful”, did you ever consider just
       separating things? What if your GUI simply is a GUI, talking to REST
       backends behind the scenes? What if your backend is not a monolithic
       beast but multiple applications that are exposed as REST services?

       It is a common misapprehension that GUI and REST backend have to be
       one single, highly coupled system. Taking the best out of each
       framework, let's explore what other ways are possible!

    <h3>Bodo Tasche</h3>
    <h2>Endless fun with Arduino and Eventmachine</h2>
    <p>
      After seven years of working as a java developer, Bodo fall in love
      with ruby and moved to cologne to work as a full time ruby developer.
      He started tinkering with hardware as a teenager with his C-64, his
      dad created the robots and he wrote the software that made them move.

      Besides coding Bodo loves diving, traveling and biking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his talk he will show how to connect an arduino with ruby using
      eventmachine. He will also
      show potential use cases and projects that can be created using this
      technique. Most of the projects can be finished on one weekend.

    <h3>Lourens Naudé</h3>
    <h2>In the Loop</h2>
    <p>
      Lourens is an independent Consultant originally from South Africa but currently based in sunny Madeira Island. He specializes in backend, platform, domain solutions and is well versed full stack and is known for his offbeat Ruby patches and extensions.

      He spends weekdays in the Platform team at <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com">wildfireapp.com</a> and pushes Open Source contributions to <a href="http://github.com/methodmissing">github.com/methodmissing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    
      The recent boom in Event Driven components and tools such as node.js, EventMachine, 0MQ and Redis resulted in product dependencies often misunderstood by development teams. All these components address the need for efficiently shifting and processing data between network, disk, memory and CPU - they fill a very specific niche for high performance data services. In practice however they often make their way into complex, coarse grained services.

      In his talk Lourens will address several gotchas through low level instrumentation and other visual cues, context switching (pun intended) between EventMachine and Redis specific examples.

    <h3>Elise Huard</h3>
    <h2>Actors on Stage</h2>
    <p>
      After her studies in metallurgy, Elise realized a job in that area was 
      not her cup of tea, and she looked for jobs in an earlier interest, software.
      
      10 years in it have helped her get a firm understanding on what works 
      and what will make you cry blood and tears on nights before deadlines.

      She’s a jack of all trades, loves reading, tinkering, food, travel, 
      learning, and people out of the ordinary.
      
      In her talk she will explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby. The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).

    <h3>Federico Brubacher</h3>
    <h2>The Expression Problem in Ruby: A focus on Traits.</h2>
    <p>
      Federico Brubacher is a Rails engineer from Uruguay, a language lover
      and a proponent of going where no man has gone before. 
      
      He has many contributions to open source and at Cubox he helps mostly 
      startups to archive their objectives.
      
      This talk will introduce you on what the expression problem is, and
      why it is relevant in Ruby. We then will explain which alternatives
      are idiomatic in Ruby and analyze pros and cons of each of them. We
      will advocate for Traits which are basically local mixins.
