    <h3>Pat Allan</h3>
    <h2>Tales of the Big White Cloud</h2>
    <p>
      Pat Allan is a freelancing web developer usually located in Melbourne, Australia. When not caught up in code, he can be found helping organise <a href="http://railscamps.com/">Rails Camps</a> and <a href="http://trampolineday.com/">Trampolines</a>. His thoughts are blogged semi-regularly at <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/">freelancing-gods.com</a>, and he’s been known to make a mean pancake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud may look all light and fluffy, but should you go flying through the depths of the internet, you will find challenges and pitfalls aplenty. Gather round as Pat puts on his storytelling hat and regales you with tales of the trials and tribulations, the technology and automation, the lessons and rewards that are part of building a service in the cloud.

    <h2>Getting Hands On with Adhearsion</h2>
    <p>
      A recovering Physics graduate, Ben now spends approximately 25 hours per day slinging Ruby and is enjoying it a lot more than quantum field theory.

      Writing voice applications is a perfect fit for him, not least as a result of his addiction to talking. That this can be directed towards a robot can only make the world a better place.
      
      Ben has a passion for integrating multiple technologies and has some interesting examples to share to demonstrate the power of Ruby in the field of communications.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Adhearsion is the first open source framework to enable the creation of telephony applications. Watch as they demonstrate how to integrate with an existing Asterisk install or develop something fresh and interactive in the cloud. Use your phone to send instant messages or collect data. Plenty of code examples will be shared as they show you how to teach Ruby new telephony tricks.

     <h3>Nick Sutterer</h3>
     <h2>Be Restful. Be web 2.0. But don't mix it</h2>
     <p>
       Nick Sutterer appreciates the beauty of elegant code, and the value of
       open source software. Through his tireless development and advocacy of
       the Cells and Apotomo gems, he has brought the
       concepts of component-oriented UI development to the world of Rails,
       proving that there should be no such thing as a
       double-render error, and that one need not be slave to the great
       monolithic view mentality. Also, he would like to have beer with you.
       
     </p>
     <p>
       While you were hacking on your frontend, frantically trying to make
       that form do a PUT, just to be “RESTful”, did you ever consider just
       separating things? What if your GUI simply is a GUI, talking to REST
       backends behind the scenes? What if your backend is not a monolithic
       beast but multiple applications that are exposed as REST services?

       It is a common misapprehension that GUI and REST backend have to be
       one single, highly coupled system. Taking the best out of each
       framework, let's explore what other ways are possible!

    <h2>Endless fun with Arduino and Eventmachine</h2>
    <p>
      After seven years of working as a java developer, Bodo fall in love
      with ruby and moved to cologne to work as a full time ruby developer.
      He started tinkering with hardware as a teenager with his C-64, his
      dad created the robots and he wrote the software that made them move.

      Besides coding Bodo loves diving, traveling and biking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his talk he will show how to connect an arduino with ruby using
      eventmachine. He will also
      show potential use cases and projects that can be created using this
      technique. Most of the projects can be finished on one weekend.

    <h3>Lourens Naudé</h3>
    <h2>In the Loop</h2>
    <p>
      Lourens is an independent Consultant originally from South Africa but currently based in sunny Madeira Island. He specializes in backend, platform, domain solutions and is well versed full stack and is known for his offbeat Ruby patches and extensions.

      He spends weekdays in the Platform team at <a href="http://www.wildfireapp.com">wildfireapp.com</a> and pushes Open Source contributions to <a href="http://github.com/methodmissing">github.com/methodmissing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    
      The recent boom in Event Driven components and tools such as node.js, EventMachine, 0MQ and Redis resulted in product dependencies often misunderstood by development teams. All these components address the need for efficiently shifting and processing data between network, disk, memory and CPU - they fill a very specific niche for high performance data services. In practice however they often make their way into complex, coarse grained services.

      In his talk Lourens will address several gotchas through low level instrumentation and other visual cues, context switching (pun intended) between EventMachine and Redis specific examples.

    <h3>Federico Brubacher</h3>
    <h2>The Expression Problem in Ruby: A focus on Traits.</h2>
    <p>
      After changing careers thrice, Federico found his true love in being a
      language lover and a Ruby fan. Part of it being the awesome
      expressiveness of the Ruby language and part its amazing community.

      You can think about Federico as your next-door abstraction junkie. He
      is a fan of all the languages and all kind of weird abstractions for
      example bananas (aka folds), monads, arrows, etc. He then applies this
      knowledge in his everyday coding in Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his mind blowing talk Federico will explain what is know as the
      Expression Problem, which you might already have suffered but you
      didn't know it. Federico will continue then to give solutions in Ruby
      and explain why traits, a Ruby 2.0 feature, will be perfect for
      nullifying the Expression Problem.

    <h3>Thorben Schröder</h3>
    <h2>Bridging the gap - Using JavaScript in Rails to write DRY rich client applications</h2>
    <p>
      Thorben has a crush on Rails since he first got his hands wet in late 2006 and he never looked back. He graduated from University with a bachelor thesis on how to scale large Rails applications. Together with Jan Steinmetz he started kopfmaschine, a Rails shop located in Bremen, Germany, where their goal is to create the living room for local hackers. Bringing good people together, build great stuff, that's what kopfmaschine is all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside normal web apps "kopfmaschine" is looking to bring their knowledge to customers who would not normally look for a web solution. Therefore they have built HTML5 apps that are used as "native" apps on Windows or mobile clients like the iPad. This was the starting point for his efforts to bridge the gap between Rails and JavaScript and that is what his talk is all about.

      Karel Minařík is as a web development mercenary doing consulting work in Ruby/Rails and evangelizing about CouchDB, Git, NoSQL and distributed architectures. You can find more about him at <a href="http://karmi.cz">karmi.cz</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His talk will touch search in general and focus on <a href="http://elasticsearch.org">ElasticSearch</a>, a promising search engine and database, which fully embraces HTTP, understands JSON and comes with advanced distributed features. It's “elastic” both in the sense of working with data, as well as horizontal scaling, and its purpose is to make advanced search features, such as geo search and complex faceted navigation/aggregation widely available.

    <h2>Scanning Strings at Supersonic Speed</h2>
    <p>
      Kornelius Kalnbach (a.k.a. murphy) is a Ruby programmer born
      in Berlin. He is in love with Ruby-chan since 2002. He also
      loves regular expressions and syntax highlighting. Thus he is tinkering with
      the CodeRay library. He works as a Rails developer since 2007,
      currently for <a href="http://sofatutor.com">sofatutor.com</a>.<br/>
      His other interests include user interfaces, design, philosophy, Shadowrun,
      and he believes there's a ghost in the shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his talk Kornelius will explain how CodeRay manages to outperform
      other syntax highlighting libraries with pure Ruby code. After comparing
      performance on different Ruby platforms, he will show the key concepts
      of fast scanning. Visualizing some advanced ideas for further speedups,
      and will explain how syntax highlighting can take advantage of
      multi-core processors.

    <h3>David Calavera</h3>
    <h2>Scanning Strings at Supersonic Speed</h2>
    <p>
      David had a great idea for a pet project once. The same day he started to work on it he had to send a patch to the JRuby project. A hundred of bugs fixed later he became a member of the JRuby Core Team.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his talk we’ll learn how to deal with the JRuby internal code from a more rubist and friendly point of view. Guided by tests we’ll discover what’s hidden underneath and we’ll learn how we can also start to contribute easily.

    <h3>Elise Huard</h3>
    <h2>Actors on Stage</h2>
    <p>
      After her studies in metallurgy, Elise realized a job in that area was 
      not her cup of tea, and she looked for jobs in an earlier interest, software.
      
      10 years in it have helped her get a firm understanding on what works 
      and what will make you cry blood and tears on nights before deadlines.

      She’s a jack of all trades, loves reading, tinkering, food, travel, 
      learning, and people out of the ordinary.
      
      In her talk she will explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby. The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).

    <h3>Federico Brubacher</h3>
    <h2>The Expression Problem in Ruby: A focus on Traits.</h2>
    <p>
      Federico Brubacher is a Rails engineer from Uruguay, a language lover
      and a proponent of going where no man has gone before. 
      
      He has many contributions to open source and at Cubox he helps mostly 
      startups to archive their objectives.
      
      This talk will introduce you on what the expression problem is, and
      why it is relevant in Ruby. We then will explain which alternatives
      are idiomatic in Ruby and analyze pros and cons of each of them. We
      will advocate for Traits which are basically local mixins.
