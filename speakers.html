    <h3>Elise Huard</h3>
    <h2>Actors on Stage</h2>
    <p>
      After her studies in metallurgy, Elise realized a job in that area was 
      not her cup of tea, and she looked for jobs in an earlier interest, software.
      
      10 years in it have helped her get a firm understanding on what works 
      and what will make you cry blood and tears on nights before deadlines.

      Sheâ€™s a jack of all trades, loves reading, tinkering, food, travel, 
      learning, and people out of the ordinary.
      
      In her talk she will explore several ways to implement the actor model in Ruby. The talk will also allude to the fact that threads in Ruby should ideally have separate state, so that all programs using threads could also use the actor model (or other similar concurrency models).

    <h3>Federico Brubacher</h3>
    <h2>The Expression Problem in Ruby: A focus on Traits.</h2>
    <p>
      Federico Brubacher is a Rails engineer from Uruguay, a language lover
      and a proponent of going where no man has gone before. 
      
      He has many contributions to open source and at Cubox he helps mostly 
      startups to archive their objectives.
      
      This talk will introduce you on what the expression problem is, and
      why it is relevant in Ruby. We then will explain which alternatives
      are idiomatic in Ruby and analyze pros and cons of each of them. We
      will advocate for Traits which are basically local mixins.
